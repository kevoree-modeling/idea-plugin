# Compilation



The Kevoree Modeling plugin allows to compile the MetaModel in one-click to Java and/or JavaScript.

Click on the metamodel file, and select **Compile to Jar** or **Compile to JS**

The compilation creates a Jar or JS file in a sub-folder, next to the MetaModel file, and adds it as a library to the current project.
This mechanism is intented to accelerate the prototyping, not for use in projects with multiple modules.
